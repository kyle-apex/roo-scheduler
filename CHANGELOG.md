# Changelog

## [0.0.11] - 2025-05-31

### Added
- Upgraded to Roo Code's latest custom_modes.yaml support

## [0.0.10] - 2025-04-25

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where `startDate` was set by default.

### Changed
- Updated scheduling logic for interval-based tasks:
  - **If a start date/time is specified:** Intervals are now calculated from the original start time. For example, for an hourly task with a start time of 10:00am, if execution is delayed (e.g., due to inactivity or the computer being off/in deep sleep) and the task runs at 10:15am, the next execution is scheduled for 11:00am.
  - **If no start time is specified:** The interval is calculated from the last execution time. For example, if the last execution was at 10:15am, the next execution will be at 11:15am.
- Updated "Usage Tips" in the README

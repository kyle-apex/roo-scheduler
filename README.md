# Roo Scheduler

**Roo Scheduler** is a task scheduling extension for VS Code that seamlessly integrates with Roo Code. It allows you to automate recurring tasks and workflows directly within your development environment.

## Key Features

### Flexible Task Scheduling

- **Time-Based Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to run at specific intervals (minutes, hours, days)
- **Day Selection**: Configure tasks to run only on specific days of the week
- **Start & Expiration Dates**: Set when tasks should begin and automatically expire
- **Activity-Based Execution**: Optionally run tasks only when there's been user activity since the last execution

### Task Interaction Options

- **Wait Mode**: Wait for a specified period of inactivity before executing a scheduled task
- **Interrupt Mode**: Automatically interrupt any running task to execute the scheduled task
- **Skip Mode**: Skip execution if another task is already running

### Seamless Roo Code Integration

Roo Scheduler connects directly with Roo Code to:

- Start new tasks in any available Roo Code mode
- Pass custom instructions to Roo Code for each scheduled task
- Manage task execution and handle conflicts intelligently

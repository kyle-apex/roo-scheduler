**Roo Scheduler** is a task scheduling extension for VS Code that seamlessly integrates with [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/). It allows you to automate recurring tasks and workflows directly within your development environment.  

This extension was created from a fork of [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) and designed using similar patterns/components to act as a functional community proof of concept and make it easier to merge if folks might want such a feature in [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) itself.

## Key Features

### Flexible Task Scheduling

- **Time-Based Scheduling**: Schedule tasks to run at specific intervals (minutes, hours, days)
- **Day Selection**: Configure tasks to run only on specific days of the week
- **Start & Expiration Dates**: Set when tasks should begin and automatically expire
- **Activity-Based Execution**: Optionally run tasks only when there's been user activity since the last execution

### Task Interaction Options

- **Wait Mode**: Wait for a specified period of inactivity before executing a scheduled task
- **Interrupt Mode**: Automatically interrupt any running task to execute the scheduled task
- **Skip Mode**: Skip execution if another task is already running

### Seamless [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) Integration

Roo Scheduler connects with [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/)'s extension points which allow it to:

- Start new tasks in any available [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) mode
- Pass custom instructions to [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/) for each scheduled task
- Provides options to execute after specified inactivity, interrupt existing tasks, or skip execution of a schedule

## Use Cases

- **Automated Code Reviews**: Schedule regular code quality checks
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- **Dependency Checks**: Regularly verify and update project dependencies
- **Codebase Analysis**: Run periodic analysis to identify optimization opportunities
- **Custom Workflows**: Automate any repetitive development task with natural language instructions (tests, memory bank, MCP etc)

## Usage Tips

- Currently, this extension will not wake up your computer to run a task.  It will run tasks if the screen is locked.  When VS Code “wakes up,” either when a computer starts or another background process is run, then any pending tasks will be run.
- Intervals are calculated differently depending on if start date time is specified.  For example, for an hourly task, if I have start date/time specified at 10:00am and the execution is delayed until 10:15am due to inactivity interruption delays or the computer being off/asleep, then the next task is scheduled for 11:00am. If I don’t specify start time, the hour interval is calculated from the last execution time, so the next execution will be 11:15am
